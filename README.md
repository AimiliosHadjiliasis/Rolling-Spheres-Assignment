# Rolling-Spheres-Assignment

***Preface***
-----------------
This is an attempt from me to recreate my Year 2 assignments in the modules of Game Concepts.
The reason that i want to recreate them is to test my skills in Object Oriented Programming.

***Tools and Technology*** 
----------------
This Project was created using C++ and my univeristy's game engine called TL-Engine.

***Project***
---------------
This assignemnt requires the implementation of a simple game. The aims of this assignment is to provide us
the ability to use FSM in order to make 3 spheres move in a square and also add some fancy abilities to 
the spheres like changing colours, change their movement from anti-clockwise to clockwise etc.

***Application GUI***
----------------------
The application that i created looks like this:

You can find a video of how the project works in my YouTube account by pressing [here](https://youtu.be/uZN9Ra6CxNw)

***How it works:***
---------------------
[IN THE API THERE IS AN INSTRUCTION SECTION ON THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN TAHT EXPLAINS HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION HOWEVER THERE IS 1 MISTAKE IN THE MOVE UP THAT IT MUST BE UP ARROW INSTEAD OF W ARROW]
1. Since there is no application created, press the play Run Button of Visual Studio IDE
2. When the appplication beggins it will look like the application gui image that is provided above
3. This means that the application is in Paused State. In order to unpause the game you have to press the the P button
4. Then you can move the Sphere objects up and Down using the arrow keys
5. If you want to change the rotation of the spherese you can press the R button. If you do that the the spheres will begin to move on hte opposite side (from clockwise to anticlockwise and vice versa)
6. If you want to increase the speed of the spheres you can press the X button. This will increasse the speed up to a specific point
7. If you want to decrease the speed of the spheres you can press the Z button. This will decrease the speed of the spheres but will not stop their movement
8. If you want to change the colours of the the spheres you have to press the C button. Then the colour of the spheres will change and be the same as the colour of the sphere next to it. The colours are changing in clockwise order
9. If you want to pause the game at any time you can press the P button
10. if you want to Exit the game you can press the ESC button
